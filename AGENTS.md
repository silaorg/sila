This is a context for AI editor/agent about the project. It's generated with a tool Airul (https://github.com/mitkury/airul) out of 10 sources. Feel free to edit .airul.json to change the sources and configure editors. Run `airul gen` to update the context after making changes to .airul.json or the sources. Remember to update TODO-AI.md after major changes in the project, keeping track of completed tasks and new developments.

# From docs/dev/project-structure.md:

# Project structure 

We have a package.json in the root of our repository that unites our packages in the npm workspace. We run `npm install`, `npm run dev` and `npm build` from the root.

This should be enough to get started after cloning the repository:
`npm install && npm run dev`

## Packages
- **packages/core** is the core functionality shared with other packages.
- **packages/client** is the client code with UI components written in Svelte.
- **packages/desktop** is a Svelte /w Vite + Electron wrapper that is using the client package. We use it for desktop builds.
- **packages/mobile** is a SvelteKit + Capacitor wrapper that is using the client package. We use it for mobile builds.
- **packages/demo** is a tool to create demo workspaces out of a JSON
- **packages/tests** is a test suit for the most important systems of Sila

## How it ties together and builds

Neither the core nor client gets their own dist/build. Rather than building - we import them to our dedicated Vite projects in the desktop and mobile packages. Each of those uses <SilaApp> Svelte component from the client with a config that has integrations for Electron and Capacitor to work with their file systems and native dialogs.

## Quick facts about our tech stack

- Standalone application (desktop + mobile)
- Desktop app runs on Electron  
- Mobile app runs on Capacitor
- Built with TypeScript
- Frontend uses Svelte 5 + SvelteKit
- Everything runs locally (no server yet) plus external APIs
- Styling via Tailwind CSS
- Components from Skeleton design system
- Inference with AI is done through AIWrapper
- Sync handled by RepTree
- Tiling tabs like in VSCode are built with TTabs
- Context for AI agent generated with Airul

# From docs/dev/for-ai/how-to-write-docs.md:

# How to write docs

Write them simply.

## Rule for the agent

* Lead with the key action or fact.
* Use plain words. Avoid jargon; if a term is required, define it once.
* Write short sentences (aim ‚â§ 15 words).
* Use active voice: ‚ÄúDo X,‚Äù not ‚ÄúX should be done.‚Äù
* One idea per sentence. One task per paragraph.
* Prefer lists and steps over long paragraphs.
* State defaults, constraints, and examples near the instruction.
* Delete filler, hedging, and marketing language.
* Use consistent terms and formatting.

## Do / Don‚Äôt

**Do**

* Show a minimal example right after the instruction.
* Name buttons, flags, files, and paths exactly.
* Call out prerequisites and errors up front.

**Don‚Äôt**

* Start with history or philosophy.
* Use acronyms without expanding them once.
* Stack multiple clauses or metaphors.

## Tiny example

**Before:** ‚ÄúIn order to facilitate initialization, the system should be configured accordingly.‚Äù
**After:** ‚ÄúConfigure the system. Then run `init`.‚Äù

# From docs/dev/for-ai/proposals.md:

# Proposals for development

When a developer asks to create a proposal for a feature or major change - write the proposal as a Markdown file in /docs/dev/proposals. Before writing a proposal explore all relevant systems and documents.

Give the developer some time to review the proposal. Expect feedback and questions.

feat(auth): add user login
fix(payment): resolve gateway timeout
ci: update release workflow
docs: update README
dev: add the core and the client as aliases to the sveltkit config

## Commit types

# From docs/dev/for-ai/skeleton.md:

# Skeleton Documentation for LLMs

> Skeleton provides a uniform design language and structured framework for controlling the look and feel of your product and user experience. It serves as an opinionated design system that aims to greatly reduce the amount of time spent managing design elements and patterns, allowing you to more quickly build and manage your frontend interfaces at scale.


## Documentation Sets

- [React package documentation](https://skeleton.dev/llms-react.txt): documentation with React specific examples.
- [Svelte package documentation](https://skeleton.dev/llms-svelte.txt): documentation with Svelte specific examples.

## Notes
- The content is automatically generated from the official documentation
- Skeleton's core features are framework agnostic, only requiring the use of [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). This provides full access to all design system features, while enabling you to standardize the design process for your framework of choice.

# From docs/dev/for-ai/svelte.md:

New in SvelteKit 5:

# Runes

## Reactivity

Reactivity with `let x = "hello"` at component top-level is replaced with:

```js
let x: string = $state("hello")
```

This makes x reactive in the component, and also in any js functions that operate on it.

Don't use `$state<T>()` to pass the type. Always use `let x: Type =`. Variables declared with `let x = "hello"` are no longer reactive.

## Derived values

Old style:
```js
$: b = a + 1
```

New style:
```js
let b = $derived(a + 1)
```

Or for more complex use cases:
```js
let b = $derived.by(() => {
    // ... more complex logic
    return a + 1;
})
```

`$derived()` takes an expression. `$derived.by()` takes a function.

## Effect

```js
let a = $state(1);
let b = $state(2);
let c;

// This will run when the component is mounted, and for every updates to a and b.
$effect(() => {
    c = a + b;
});
```

Note: 
- Values read asynchronously (promises, setTimeout) inside `$effect` are not tracked.
- Values inside objects are not tracked directly inside `$effect`:

```js
// This will run once, because `state` is never reassigned (only mutated)
$effect(() => {
    state;
});

// This will run whenever `state.value` changes
$effect(() => {
    state.value;
});
```

An effect only depends on the values that it read the last time it ran.

```js
$effect(() => {
    if (a || b) {
        // ...
    }
});
```

If `a` was true, `b` was not read, and the effect won't run when `b` changes.

## Props

Old way to pass props to a component:
```js
export let a = "hello";
export let b;
```

New way:
```js
let {a = "hello", b, ...everythingElse} = $props()
```

`a` and `b` are reactive.

Types:
```js
let {a = "hello", b}: {a: string, b: number} = $props()
```

Note: Do NOT use this syntax for types:
```js
let { x = 42 } = $props<{ x?: string }>();  // ‚ùå Incorrect
```

# Slots and snippets

Instead of using `<slot />` in a component, you should now do:

```js
let { children } = $props()
// ...
{@render children()}  // This replaces <slot />
```

# Event Handling

In Svelte 5 the events do not use `on:event` syntax, they use `onevent` syntax.

In Svelte 5 `on:click` syntax is not allowed. Event handlers have been given a facelift in Svelte 5. Whereas in Svelte 4 we use the `on:` directive to attach an event listener to an element, in Svelte 5 they are properties like any other (in other words - remove the colon):

```svelte
<button onclick={() => count++}>
  clicks: {count}
</button>
```

`preventDefault` and `once` are removed in Svelte 5. Normal HTML event management is advised:

```svelte
<script>
  function once(fn) {
    return function(event) {
      if (fn) fn.call(this, event);
      fn = null;
    };
  }

  function preventDefault(fn) {
    return function(event) {
      event.preventDefault();
      fn.call(this, event);
    };
  }
</script>

<button onclick={once(preventDefault(handler))}>...</button>
```
