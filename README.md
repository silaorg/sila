Sila works like ChatGPT, but in Sila you own your assistants, chats, and all generated data.

## Features

### Workspaces

Organize your chats and assistants into separate workspaces. Each workspace can have its own main language, folder layout, and theme. Create multiple workspaces for different purposes and switch quickly.

### Local first

Workspaces are stored locally by default. You can sync them with iCloud, Dropbox, etc., to use across devices. Your assistants, chats, and generated data remain under your control.
No accounts required. Sila works offline if the AI model runs on your device.

### Any AI

From OpenAI, Google to Anthropic to Ollama and any OpenAI-compatible APIs. Bring your own keys.

### Assistants

Create your own assistants with their prompts, AI models, and tools.

### Tabs like in VSCode

Create and switch between tabs, and split windows. It works almost like VSCode. You can have multiple conversations open across tabs, chat with different assistants at the same time, and quickly switch between conversations.

### Many themes

Use different themes for your workspaces; from colorful to boring. A simple way to distinguish workspaces.

### No subscriptions

Pay as you go, either for API costs from AI providers or the actual compute if you run models yourself.
