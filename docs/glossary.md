Helps [assistants](#assistant) to think. It's usually a large language model (LLM) served from a model provider, such as OpenAI.

- Chosen per assistant or chat; you can switch models anytime
- Works with OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Ollama, and OpenAI‑compatible APIs
- Capabilities vary (context window, tools/functions, vision/audio, token limits, cost)

### assistant
Reusable, configurable helper that follows instructions to perform tasks in a workspace.

Also could be called: agent, bot

- A chat inherits its assistant’s instructions, chosen model, tools, and target folder
- Works with OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Ollama, and OpenAI‑compatible APIs
- Stored locally as files you own; switch models without losing context
