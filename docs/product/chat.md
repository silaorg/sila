# Powerful chat

Sila's chat is designed for deep work and flexible exploration.

## Chat with your files

Drag images or documents into a conversation and Sila keeps them inside your workspace. The assistant can reference these files so you can discuss screenshots, notes or research without leaving the app.

## Branch your ideas

Every reply in Sila can branch into a different direction. Try alternate prompts, compare multiple answers or explore a tangent without losing the original flow. Branches are easy to switch between and to merge later.

## Edit anything

Need to tweak a question or fix a typo? Edit any message in place. Sila updates the conversation instantly, keeping the thread tidy and saving you from starting over.

## More than ChatGPT

ChatGPT offers a linear history that can't be easily edited. Sila gives you a workspace where conversations evolveâ€”attach files, iterate on branches and refine your messages whenever you like.
