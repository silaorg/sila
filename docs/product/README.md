# Features of Sila

## Workspaces

Organize your chats and assistants into separate workspaces. Each workspace can have its own assistants, folders, theme, and language. Create multiple workspaces for different purposes and switch quickly.

## Local first

Workspaces are stored locally. You can sync them with iCloud, Dropbox, etc., to use across devices. Your assistants, chats, and generated data remain under your control.
No accounts required. Sila works offline if the AI model runs on your device.

## Any AI models

From OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic to Ollama — plus any OpenAI-compatible APIs. Bring your own keys.

## Assistants

Create your own assistants with their instructions, AI models, and tools. Assistants can support different workflows. For example, one assistant can always search a specific source, reference a document, and create conversations into a chosen folder in your workspace.

## Chats

...

## Tabs like in VSCode

Create and switch between tabs, and split windows. It works almost like VSCode. You can have multiple conversations open across tabs, chat with different assistants at the same time, and quickly reference or switch from one chat to another.

## Many themes

Use different themes for your workspaces — from colorful to boring. It's a simple way to set a mood or tell your workspaces apart.

## No subscriptions

Pay as you go, either for API costs from AI providers or the actual compute if you run models yourself.
