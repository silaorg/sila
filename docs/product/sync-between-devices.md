# Sync between devices

Sila makes it simple to take your workspace with you.

## How to sync

1. Locate your workspace folder in the Sila data directory.
2. Move or create the workspace inside a folder that is synced by iCloud, Dropbox, Google Drive or any other cloud storage.
3. Open Sila on each device and point it to that workspace folder.

That's it—each device maintains a full local copy and updates flow through your chosen cloud service. Because Sila is local‑first, conflicts are rare and are resolved automatically.

## Offline friendly

You can continue working even if a device loses connection. When the cloud service syncs again, Sila merges the changes so every device ends up with the latest version.

## Benefits over ChatGPT

With ChatGPT, your conversations stay locked in one online account. Sila lets you use the tools you already trust for backup and sync, giving you redundancy and control without depending on a single provider.
