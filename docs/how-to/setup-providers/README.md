# How to setup AI model providers

AI models are like brains for Sila, and you can choose which to use and switch between them quickly (see [Any AI](../../features/any-ai.md)). As new models come out, Sila will support them automatically.

If you want the simplest setup, start with [OpenRouter](./openrouter.md). It gives you one API key that works with lots of models.

AI Providers:
- [OpenRouter](./openrouter.md) (recommended first)
- [OpenAI](./openai.md)
- [Anthropic](./anthropic.md)
- [DeepSeek](./deepseek.md)
- [Google Gemini](./google.md)
- [Groq](./groq.md)
- [xAI](./xai.md)
- [Cohere](./cohere.md)
- [Mistral](./mistral.md)
- [Ollama](./ollama.md)
- [Exa](./exa.md)
- [Fal.ai](./falai.md)
