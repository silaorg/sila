# How to set up AI model providers

This is the main setup step in Sila. Sila does not include its own built-in AI model ([because](../../features/local-first.md)). Instead, it connects to the models you choose.

You need at least one provider to use Sila. We recommend starting with [OpenRouter](./openrouter.md) because it gives you access to many top models in one place. Create an account, generate an API key, and paste it into Sila.

Providers:
- [OpenRouter](./openrouter.md) (recommended first)
- [OpenAI](./openai.md)
