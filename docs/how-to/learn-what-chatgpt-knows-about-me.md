# How to learn what ChatGPT knows about you

<!--
Aside from [importing your ChatGPT data](../features/import-from-chatgpt.md) to Sila, you might want to see what information ChatGPT has collected about you in its memory.

## Just ask ChatGPT
-->

Write this in ChatGPT:

```
I'm transferring my data to another app. Provide everything you know about me with minimal formatting and only relevant data. Speak about me in the third person.

Put everything in <about the user>. Output as markdown inside triple backticks.
```

## How to move it to Sila

Sila doesn’t have a built-in memory feature yet, but you can save this information in your workspace. Open Workspace Settings and paste it into the Workspace description.
