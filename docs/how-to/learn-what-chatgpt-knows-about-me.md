# How to learn what ChatGPT knows about you

Aside from [importing your ChatGPT data](../features/import-from-chatgpt.md) to Sila, you might want to see what information ChatGPT has collected about you in its memory.

## Just ask ChatGPT

Use this prompt:

```
I'm transferring my data to another app. Provide everything you know about me with minimal formatting and only relevant data. Speak about me in the third person.

Put everything in <about the user>. Output as markdown behind ticks.
```

## How to move it to Sila

Go to the default assistant or create a new one in [Assistants](../features/assistants.md) and just add what ChatGPT gave you to the instruction.
