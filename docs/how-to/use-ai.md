# How to use AI

Here we have practical, short guides on how to use AI in Sila.

@TODO: give examples for each

## Instead of Google with follow up questions

Just ask questions to the default assistant. It will try to answer based on its knowledge or will search internet if the answer is specific. The advatnage over googling is that you can follow up with questions. When the assistant searches - you can alsways see the provided sources and explore them yourself.

## Search in your documents

Attach your PDFs, Word docs and text files to chats OR upload them to your workspace and then the agent in Sila can search them.

## Create and edit documents

Aside from getting things written for you in chat - you can ask to make a text file and then edit it with follow up questions. After the AI is done you download it.

## Research

Ask assistants to do a research. It's a more powerful case of using search where the assistant will start searching whatever it things fit the request.

## Generate and edit images

Ask the assistant that has access to image generation to make images for you and ask to edit them. @TODO: why
