# How to use AI

Here's how you can use AI assistants in Sila.

## Instead of Google, with follow-up questions

Ask questions to the default assistant. It will answer from its knowledge or search the internet when needed. The advantage over search engines is that you can ask follow-up questions. When the assistant searches, you can see the sources and explore them yourself.

## Research

Ask assistants to do research. It is a more powerful version of search where the assistant gathers sources that fit your request.

## Reference your documents and files

Attach PDFs, images, or text docs. You can also upload files to your workspace so the assistant can reference them.

## Create and edit documents

You can ask for a text file and edit it with follow-up questions. When you are done, download it.

## Generate and edit images

Ask an assistant with image generation enabled to create images and edit them.
