<TODO>Examples for each</TODO>

## Instead of Google, with follow-up questions

Ask questions to the default assistant. It will answer from its knowledge or search the internet when needed. The advantage over search engines is that you can ask follow-up questions. When the assistant searches, you can see the sources and explore them yourself.

## Search in your documents

Attach PDFs, Word docs, or text files to chats. You can also upload files to your workspace so the assistant can search them.

## Create and edit documents

Besides generating text in chat, you can ask for a text file and edit it with follow-up questions. When you are done, download the file.

## Research

Ask assistants to do research. It is a more powerful version of search where the assistant gathers sources that fit your request.

## Generate and edit images

Ask an assistant with image generation enabled to create images and edit them.

## Learn and study

Have an assistant help you learn new topics instead of doing all the work for you.
