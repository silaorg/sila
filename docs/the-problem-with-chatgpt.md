# The problem with ChatGPT

OpenAI - the creator of ChatGPT - owns your data. They want to create a super assistant that people will depend on more and more over time. OpenAI will try to trap users in their platform, making it hard to switch to something else - because they hold on to their data and workflows. With Sila, we provide a counterbalance: a ChatGPTâ€‘like experience where you (or your team, organization) own the data and can use any AI models.

## How Sila solves this

- **[Own your data](own.md)**: Keep your conversations, assistants, and files under your control with local-first storage
- **[Workspaces](features/workspaces.md)**: Separate work and personal AI conversations into different workspaces stored in different locations
- **[Import from ChatGPT](features/import-from-chatgpt.md)**: Migrate your existing conversations and memory about you to maintain continuity
