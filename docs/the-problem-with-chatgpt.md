# The problem with ChatGPT

OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, owns your data and serves only their AI models to you. They want to create a super assistant and hook as many people on it while upselling and showing ads. They are building a huge business and will extract profits from anyone who uses ChatGPT. They will try to make it hard to switch from ChatGPT because they hold your data and workflows while improving ChatGPT to make it more personalized.

Same goes for Gemini, Claude, and any major AI player.

## How about Sila

We build Sila as a counterbalance: a ChatGPT-like experience where you (or your team) own the data and can use any AI models.
