# The problem with ChatGPT

OpenAI - the creator of ChatGPT - owns your conversations, attachments, generated files, projects, etc. OpenAI hooks you by making ChatGPT increasingly useful while upselling more expensive tiers and locking you into their models. They want to create a super assistant that you will depend on more and more over time. With Sila, we provide a counterbalance: a ChatGPTâ€‘like experience where you (or your team, organization) own the data and can use any AI models.

## How Sila solves this

- **[Own your data](own.md)**: Keep your conversations, assistants, and files under your control with local-first storage
- **[Workspaces](features/workspaces.md)**: Separate work and personal AI conversations into different workspaces stored in different locations
- **[Import from ChatGPT](features/import-from-chatgpt.md)**: Migrate your existing conversations and memory about you to maintain continuity
