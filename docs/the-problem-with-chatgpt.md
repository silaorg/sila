# The problem with ChatGPT

OpenAI - the creator of ChatGPT - owns your data and conversations. They can hook you by making ChatGPT increasingly useful while upselling more expensive tiers and locking you into their models. With Sila, we aim to provide a counterbalance: a ChatGPTâ€‘like experience where you (or your business) own the data and can use any AI models.
