# The problem with ChatGPT

OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, owns your data. They want to create a super assistant that people depend on over time. That can make it hard to switch, because they hold your data and workflows. Sila is a counterbalance: a ChatGPT-like experience where you (or your team) own the data and can use any AI models.

## How Sila solves this

- **[Own your data](own.md)**: Keep your conversations, assistants, and files under your control with local-first storage
- **[Workspaces](features/workspaces.md)**: Separate work and personal AI conversations into different workspaces stored in different locations
<!--
- **[Import from ChatGPT](features/import-from-chatgpt.md)**: Migrate your existing conversations and memory about you to maintain continuity
