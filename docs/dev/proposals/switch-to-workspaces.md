Here is a high-level map of what you already have and how the three packages talk to each other.  (I’m using the aliases that appear in your `svelte.config.js` files.)

Key observations
----------------
1. **Source-level coupling:**  
   Desktop consumes raw Svelte source from `client` via  
   `alias '@client': '../client/src/lib'`.  
   As a result the desktop build **re-compiles all client code**.  
   That is why the same dev-dependencies (Svelte, Tailwind, Skeleton, etc.) re-appear in both `package.json`s.

2. **Tailwind / Skeleton CSS:**  
   • Both packages own their own `tailwind.config.ts` and global `app.css`.  
   • Desktop’s `app.css` currently imports every Skeleton theme; client doesn’t have a global stylesheet, so its components rely on Tailwind classes being compiled at build time.

3. **No real monorepo management:**  
   The root `package.json` just calls `npm install` three times; there is no `workspaces` field, so npm (or pnpm/yarn) can’t hoist shared deps.

Why things feel “messy”
-----------------------
• Two builds do almost the same work (compile client twice).  
• The same devDeps are listed in two places, so versions drift easily.  
• Two Tailwind configs + two global CSS entrypoints → hard to know where a class comes from.  
• Debugging an Electron issue means stepping through code that was re-bundled inside desktop, not the code that *client* just built.

A simpler, debuggable architecture
----------------------------------
Goal: *Client* is the **only** package that owns UI, Tailwind, and Skeleton.  
*Desktop* is a thin Electron wrapper that just mounts the *already-built* client bundle and exposes native helpers.

Step-by-step plan
-----------------
1. ❏ **Turn the repo into a real workspace.**  
   Add at root `package.json`:
   ```jsonc
   {
     "private": true,
     "workspaces": ["packages/*"]
   }
   ```
   Run `npm install -ws` (or switch to pnpm/yarn workspaces).  
   All shared deps (Svelte, Tailwind, Skeleton, …) will be hoisted automatically; desktop can delete them from its own `package.json`.

2. ❏ **Package the client as a library build.**  
   a. Install `@sveltejs/package` in client.  
   b. In `packages/client/svelte.config.js` export both an **app** and a **library** build:
   ```js
   import adapterStatic from "@sveltejs/adapter-static";
   import adapterPkg    from "@sveltejs/adapter-auto"; // produces ./dist

   const config = {
     kit: {
       adapter: adapterStatic({ /* web build */ }),
       package: {
         dir: "dist",  // library output
         emitTypes: true
       },
       alias: { /* keep @client, @core */ }
     }
   };
   export default config;
   ```
   c. Add `npm run build:lib` → `svelte-kit package`; this produces  
      `packages/client/dist/index.js` + `style.css`.

3. ❏ **Expose “root component” + CSS from client.**  
   In `packages/client/src/lib/index.ts` re-export whatever desktop should mount:
   ```ts
   export { default as SupaRoot } from "./SupaApp.svelte";
   ```
   After `build:lib`, desktop can import `import { SupaRoot } from "supa-client";`.

4. ❏ **Slim desktop down to wrapper code.**
   • Remove Tailwind / Skeleton devDeps from `packages/desktop/package.json`.  
   • Delete `tailwind.config.ts` and `app.css`.  
   • In `packages/desktop/src/routes/+layout.svelte`:
     ```svelte
     <script lang="ts">
       // library build already contains CSS bundling via Vite, so:
       import "supa-client/style.css";
       import { SupaRoot } from "supa-client";
     </script>

     <SupaRoot/>
     ```
   Desktop now no longer compiles Tailwind/Skeleton; it merely includes the pre-built CSS.

5. ❏ **Native bridges stay local to desktop.**  
   Continue to inject FS / process / dialog helpers in desktop; export them as small utility modules and pass them into the root component via props or a context provider.

6. ❏ **One Tailwind config to rule them all (optional but clean).**  
   Move the Tailwind preset to `/tailwind.preset.ts`:
   ```ts
   export default {
     theme:{extend:{}},
     plugins:[require("@tailwindcss/forms")]
   } satisfies Config;
   ```
   Then `packages/client/tailwind.config.ts` just does:
   ```ts
   import base from '../../tailwind.preset';
   export default { ...base, content:['./src/**/*.{svelte,ts}'] };
   ```

   Desktop no longer needs its own config because it no longer compiles Tailwind.

7. ❏ **Debugging experience.**  
   • Build client once → you debug the same bundle in the browser *and* in Electron (no duplicate webpack transforms).  
   • Source maps originate in the client build, so stack traces point at original `.svelte` files.

Result
------
• **Single source of truth** for UI, styling, and design system.  
• **One copy** of every devDependency.  
• Electron wrapper is <200 lines of glue; when you upgrade Tailwind or Skeleton you only touch the client.  
• Faster builds, simpler stack traces, less “where is this class generated”.

Feel free to tackle these steps gradually—step 1 (workspaces) already removes a lot of duplication, and step 2–4 can follow once you’re comfortable with `svelte-kit package`.

# Implementation history (failed)

Summary of what we attempted

1. Turned the monorepo into a real npm-workspace  
   • Added `"workspaces": ["packages/*"]` to the root package.json and removed the triple-install script.  
   • Ran a clean `npm install` → hoisted all shared deps.

2. Made `packages/client` buildable as a component library  
   • Installed `@sveltejs/package`, added `npm run build:lib`.  
   • Added `files`/`exports`/`svelte`/`sideEffects` to its package.json.  
   • Added a minimal `src/app.html` (needed by the packager).  
   • Library now compiles into `packages/client/dist`.

3. Changed the desktop shell to *use* the compiled library  
   • In `packages/desktop/svelte.config.js` the `@client` alias was changed from `../client/src/lib` → `../client/dist`.  
   • Tailwind’s `content` glob extended to also scan the library bundle.

4. Vite import-resolver issues  
   • The packager rewrote `@core/...` imports into relative paths like `../../../../core/src/...`.  
   • Desktop’s dev server refused those paths as “outside fs allow-list”.  
   • Added `server.fs.allow` entries in desktop’s `vite.config.js` for  
     `packages/core/src` and `packages/client/dist`.  
   • (During debugging a `core` symlink was briefly created at repo root; later identified as unnecessary.)

5. Worker import glitch  
   • The bundle referenced `../opsParser.worker.ts`; the file is emitted as `.js`.  
   • Fixed source: `new Worker(new URL('../opsParser.worker.js', import.meta.url))`.

Remaining blocker that appeared  
Despite adding the allow-list, Vite/Svelte still reports “Failed to resolve import …core/src/…”.  
That means paths still resolve outside the allowed folders (or the updated config file was overwritten/removed).

Problems encountered  
• Relative paths generated by the packager break alias-based resolution.  
• Vite dev server enforces `server.fs.allow`, so every external path must be listed.  
• Editing config files while dev scripts are running can leave stale processes (port 6969 busy).  
• Rebuilding the client library after every path tweak is necessary, or stale code remains in `dist`.

Where we left off  
Desktop config files were accidentally deleted during cleanup.  
Re-adding them and ensuring `server.fs.allow` contains

```
join(__dirname, '..', 'core', 'src'),
join(__dirname, '..', 'client', 'dist')
```

will solve the “Failed to resolve import …core/src”.  
Alternatively, keep the original `@core` alias in *client* source so the packager doesn’t rewrite paths at all.

That’s the concise history and the issues we ran into.

<!--- ===================================================================== -->
## Further considerations

* **Replace path aliases with real workspace package imports.**  
  Instead of `import { X } from "@core/..."` backed by `alias: { '@core': '../core/src' }`, give each sub-folder an actual package name (e.g. `@supa/core`, `@supa/client`) and import them the normal npm way:
  ```ts
  // inside client
  import { SpaceManager } from '@supa/core/spaces/SpaceManager';
  // inside desktop
  import { SupaRoot } from '@supa/client';
  ```
  This removes Rollup/Vite rewrite surprises, eliminates extra alias config in every tool, and makes dependencies explicit in `package.json`.  It works both inside the monorepo (using `"workspace:*"` versions) and after publishing to npm.

### Dev-workflow if we rely on `dist` only

If we decide **not** to keep an alias to the raw sources during development, the UX can still be smooth by running the library packager in *watch* mode side-by-side with Electron:

```jsonc
// root package.json (scripts section)
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "npm-run-all -p build:lib:watch desktop:dev",
    "build:lib:watch": "cd packages/client && svelte-package --watch --sourcemap",
    "desktop:dev": "cd packages/desktop && npm run dev"
  }
}
```
* `svelte-package --watch` re-emits `packages/client/dist` whenever you touch a `.svelte` or `.ts` file inside the client.
* Vite in the desktop process sees the file timestamp change and triggers its own fast HMR reload.
* You keep a **single source of truth** (no alias), and you still get near-instant feedback.

Any watcher tool you prefer ( `concurrently`, `npm-run-all`, `turbo run`, pnpm `-r` scripts ) works; just make sure the library watch starts **before** the desktop dev server so the first build exists when Electron boots.

### What the client **dist** build contains

`svelte-package` compiles every `.svelte` component and `.ts` file into plain ESM **JavaScript** plus source-maps; Tailwind/PostCSS rolls all required utilities into a single `style.css`.  
Directory outline after `npm run build:lib`:

```
packages/client/dist/
├─ index.js          # entry that re-exports public components
├─ style.css         # Tailwind + Skeleton output (single file)
├─ *.js              # one per component / util module
├─ *.d.ts            # matching type declarations
└─ *.map             # source-maps (point back to original .svelte / .ts)
```

No raw `.svelte` or Tailwind configs are shipped.

### What desktop has to do

```ts
import { SupaRoot } from 'supa-client';   // JS bundle
import 'supa-client/style.css';           // pre-generated CSS
```

That’s it—desktop never runs Tailwind or PostCSS; it only bundles already-compiled assets.  Source-maps ensure breakpoints still open the real `.svelte` / `.ts` files during debugging.
