# Merge feat/electron-and-capacitor into main

## Overview
Proposal to merge the `feat/electron-and-capacitor` branch into `main` while preserving a clean git history and ensuring all commits from main are included.

## Current State
- **Main branch**: 756 commits
- **feat/electron-and-capacitor branch**: 345 commits
- **Missing commits**: 411 commits from main are not in the feature branch
- **Branch divergence**: The feature branch appears to have diverged from main at some point

## Proposed Approach: Rebase and Merge

### Step 1: Rebase onto main
```bash
git checkout feat/electron-and-capacitor
git rebase main
```

### Step 2: Force push the rebased branch
```bash
git push origin feat/electron-and-capacitor --force-with-lease
```

### Step 3: Merge into main
```bash
git checkout main
git merge feat/electron-and-capacitor
```

### Step 4: Push main and cleanup
```bash
git push origin main
git branch -d feat/electron-and-capacitor
git push origin --delete feat/electron-and-capacitor
```

## Benefits
- Creates a linear, clean git history
- Includes all commits from main
- Preserves all feature branch commits
- Makes the project history easier to understand
- Maintains the chronological order of development

## Risks
- Rebase may require conflict resolution
- Need to ensure no uncommitted changes before starting
- Force push required for the rebased feature branch
- May need to coordinate with other developers if they have local copies of the feature branch

## Alternative Approaches Considered
1. **Merge with --no-ff**: Creates merge commit but preserves branch history
2. **Squash merge**: Combines all commits into one, loses detailed history
3. **Cherry-pick**: More complex, manual process

## Pre-merge Checklist
- [ ] No uncommitted changes in working directory
- [ ] Test rebase on a copy first
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass
- [ ] Review conflicts if any arise during rebase
- [ ] Coordinate with team members who might have the feature branch checked out

## Post-merge Actions
- [ ] Update documentation if needed
- [ ] Notify team members of the merge
- [ ] Consider archiving the feature branch
- [ ] Update any CI/CD pipelines if necessary
