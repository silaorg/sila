# Proposal: Migrate from Tauri to Electron + Multi-Platform Architecture

## Overview

Replace **Tauri** with **Electron** for desktop while establishing a unified architecture for web and mobile platforms using **Capacitor**. This migration addresses performance and debugging limitations while setting up a scalable multi-platform foundation.

## Migration Rationale

**Current Issues with Tauri:**
- macOS WebView performance issues and lag
- Linux compatibility problems across distributions
- Limited debugging capabilities compared to Chromium-based solutions
- Inconsistent behavior across platforms

**Benefits of Electron:**
- Predictable Chromium engine across all platforms
- Superior debugging tools and development experience
- Larger ecosystem and community support
- Better performance tooling and profiling

## Proposed Architecture

### Package Structure
```text
packages/
├── core/            ← Shared domain logic, utilities, and business rules
├── client/          ← Component library (shared UI, stores, utils)
├── shared-config/   ← Shared SvelteKit configurations and tooling
├── desktop/         ← SvelteKit app + Electron wrapper
├── web/             ← SvelteKit app for web deployment
└── mobile/          ← SvelteKit app + Capacitor wrapper
```

### Key Architectural Decisions

**Client as Component Library:**
- Transform `client/` from standalone SvelteKit app to component library
- Each platform imports and uses client components
- Shared state management and business logic

**Platform-Specific SvelteKit Apps:**
- Each platform (desktop, web, mobile) has its own SvelteKit app
- Platform-specific routing, features, and configurations
- Consistent development experience across platforms

**Shared Configuration:**
- Centralized build configurations in `shared-config/`
- Platform-specific overrides without duplication
- Consistent tooling and dependencies

## Benefits

### Development Experience
- **Simple Getting Started**: `npm install` → `npm run dev` → working Electron app
- **Intuitive Commands**: `npm run dev` (desktop), `npm run dev:web` (browser)
- **Unified Architecture**: All platforms use SvelteKit + client library pattern
- **Better Debugging**: Electron's Chromium DevTools vs WebView limitations
- **Seamless HMR**: Hot reloading across all platforms
- **Type Safety**: Direct TypeScript integration without build coordination

### Scalability
- **Independent Deployment**: Each platform can be released separately
- **Shared Components**: Write UI once, use everywhere
- **Platform Flexibility**: Custom features per platform while sharing core logic
- **Future-Proof**: Easy to add new platforms (TV, watch, etc.)

### Performance
- **Bundle Optimization**: Tree-shaking ensures only used components per platform
- **Predictable Performance**: Consistent Chromium engine vs variable WebView
- **Better Profiling**: Electron's performance tools vs limited Tauri debugging

## Trade-offs

### Complexity
- **Initial Setup**: More complex monorepo structure
- **Dependency Management**: Coordinating versions across packages
- **Build Process**: Client library must build before platform apps

### Bundle Size
- **Electron Impact**: Larger desktop app bundles (~100-200MB vs ~10-20MB)
- **Mitigation**: Tree-shaking and lazy loading minimize unused code

### Security
- **Electron Considerations**: Requires careful IPC and preload script implementation
- **Mitigation**: Follow Electron security best practices

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Architecture Setup
- Create `shared-config/` package with base configurations
- Restructure `client/` as component library
- Set up proper exports and build process

### Phase 2: Platform Creation
- Create `desktop/` SvelteKit app with Electron wrapper
- Create `web/` SvelteKit app for web deployment
- Create `mobile/` SvelteKit app with Capacitor wrapper

### Phase 3: Migration & Testing
- Migrate existing features to new architecture
- Test cross-platform compatibility
- Remove Tauri dependencies

## Success Metrics

- **Performance**: Improved rendering performance on macOS
- **Debugging**: Faster issue resolution with better tools
- **Development Speed**: Reduced time for cross-platform feature development
- **Maintainability**: Easier configuration management and updates

## Next Steps

1. **Approval**: Get team consensus on architecture approach
2. **Implementation**: Follow [detailed implementation guide](./electron-implementation.md)
3. **Testing**: Validate performance improvements and feature parity
4. **Rollout**: Gradual migration with fallback plans
