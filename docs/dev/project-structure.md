# Project structure 

We have a package.json in the root of our repository that unites our packages in the npm workspace. We run `npm install`, `npm run dev` and `npm build` from the root.

This should be enough to get started after cloning the repository:
`npm install && npm run dev`

## Packages
- **packages/core** is the core functionality shared with client.
- **packages/client** is the client code with UI components written in Svelte.
- **packages/desktop** is a Svelte /w Vite + Electron wrapper that is using the client package. We use it for desktop builds.
- **packages/mobile** is a SvelteKit + Capacitor wrapper that is using the client package. We use it for mobile builds.
- **packages/demo** is a tool to create demo workspaces out of a JSON

## How it ties together and builds

Neither the core nor client gets their own dist/build. Rather than building - we import them to our dedicated Vite projects in the desktop and mobile packages. Each of those uses <SupaApp> Svelte component from the client with a config that has integrations for Electron and Capacitor to work with their file systems and native dialogs.
