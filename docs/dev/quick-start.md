# Quick start for devs

## Start in in 3 steps:
1. Clone the repository `git clone git@github.com:silaorg/sila.git`
2. Run in your terminal at the root of the repository - `cd sila && npm install && npm run dev` to install all the necessary npm packages and launch a desktop build.
3. To build for production - `npm run build`

## Debug with breakpoints

If you want to debug with breakpoints in a VSCode-based editor (e.g Cursor), go to "Start Debugging F5" and start "ðŸ‘‰ Debug Electron All".
