# Quick start for devs

Just 3 steps:
1. Clone the repository
2. Run in your terminal at the root of the repository - `npm install && npm run dev` to install all the necessary npm packages (all that you need) and launch a desktop build.
3. To build for production, run - `npm run build`

If you want to debug with breakpoints in a VSCode-based editor (e.g Cursor), go to "Start Debugging F5" and start "ðŸ‘‰ Debug Electron All".

We try to make it simple to run and build the project, as well as to understand how it all works. The whole setup is quite easy. Learn about it here: [project structure](project-structure.md)
