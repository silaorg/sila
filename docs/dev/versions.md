# How we version Sila

In v1.2.3:

1 is a major — we change it when the structure of [spaces](../glossary/space.md) changes.

2 is a minor — we change it when the app changes significantly enough that we need to download the whole app to update.

3 is a patch — we change it for fixes that don't require a full download and don't change anything about spaces.

See [How we build and release](./releases.md) for the release process.
