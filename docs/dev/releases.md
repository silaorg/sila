# How we build and release

We use GitHub Actions workflows to automate the entire release process.

Main idea: code is the source of truth. We bump `packages/desktop/package.json` with `npm version`, which creates a `desktop-vX.Y.Z` tag. CI triggers on that tag and validates the tag equals the code version before building.

We release in three steps:
1) Create a draft release on Github
2) Build and upload those builds to the draft release (automatic)
3) Publish the draft as the latest release

## Create a draft
- Trigger: push a tag `desktop-vX.Y.Z`
- Workflow: "release-1-draft"
- Result: a draft GitHub Release with autogenerated notes (no binaries yet)
- Validates that the tag version matches `packages/desktop/package.json` version
- Automatically triggers the build and upload workflow

## Build and upload builds (All platforms on CI)
- Trigger: automatically triggered by "release-1-draft" workflow
- Workflow: "release-2-build-upload"
- Builds and uploads macOS (signed + notarized), Windows, and Linux artifacts to the same draft release
- Uses Git LFS for asset handling (provider images, icons, etc.)

## Publish the draft
- Workflow: "release-3-finalize" (manual, input the tag)
- Sets `draft=false` so users and auto-updaters see the new version

## Github actions
See `.github/workflows/` in the root
Use `gh` cli tool to inspect workflows if needed

## Notes
- All platforms are built on CI. macOS artifacts are code-signed and notarized automatically.
- We produce a single universal macOS DMG (Intel + Apple Silicon).
- The latest public release is available on the download page: [silain.com/download](https://www.silain.com/download).

## Updates in the app (auto-update)

We ship updates via **GitHub Releases** in two forms:

- **Electron app update** (the executable): handled by `electron-updater` (GitHub provider via `packages/desktop/package.json` → `build.publish`).
- **Desktop build update** (web assets): a `desktop-v{version}.zip` asset that the app can download + extract at runtime.

Update strategy (see `packages/desktop/src-electron/updates/updater.js`):
- If the available update is a **patch** bump and a matching `desktop-v{version}.zip` exists, prefer the desktop build update.
- Otherwise (minor/major, or no matching zip), download the full Electron app update.
