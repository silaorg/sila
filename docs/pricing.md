# Sila is free for anyone, for any use

It's fully open source, so the app is free. You can use it anywhere. No restrictions.

## What you pay for

Sila itself costs nothing. You only pay for:

- **AI model usage**: When you use AI models from providers like OpenAI, Google, or Anthropic
- **Local compute**: If you run models locally (hardware and electricity costs)

## AI model costs

You pay AI providers directly for inference (the model's compute).

- **You bring your own keys**: OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, or your own server (OpenAIâ€‘compatible APIs)
- **Pay as you go**: Providers bill for tokens (text), images, and audio minutes
- **Local models**: With Ollama or similar, inference is free to use, but you pay with your hardware resources and electricity
