# Tabs and tiles

Sila lets you work across multiple conversations with tabs and split tiles — similar to VSCode and modern browsers.

## What you can do

- **Open multiple tabs**: Keep several chats, assistants, or files open at once. Switch instantly.
- **Split into tiles**: Arrange views side by side. Compare chats or draft in one tile while referencing another.
- **Drag and drop**: Reorder tabs, move them between tiles, or pop them into new splits.

## Why it matters

- **Faster context switching**: Jump between tasks without losing state.
- **Better parallel work**: Chat with different assistants at the same time.
- **Reference while writing**: Keep sources in one tile and compose in another.
