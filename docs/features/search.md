# Search in Sila

Find answers across the web and inside your workspaces.

You can search in two ways: by asking an assistant or using the app’s search UI.

## Search with assistants

- By default, assistants can search the internet and your workspaces. You can enable or disable this per assistant.
- When searching a workspace, assistants can reference past conversations and files used in those conversations.
- Ask a natural question (for example, “Summarize our notes on onboarding”) and the assistant will locate relevant context.

## Search from the UI

- Use the built-in search to find content across your workspaces.
- Supports both exact (keyword) and semantic (meaning-based) matches.
- Great for quickly locating chats, messages, and files by title or content.

## Tips

- Be specific. Add keywords that appear in the chat or file name.
- Use quotes for exact phrases.
- Turn off internet search if you want results from your device only.
