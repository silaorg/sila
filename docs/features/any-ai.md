# Use any AI you like

Sila is not tied to a single model or provider. You decide which AI services to use and can change them at any time.

## Bring your own keys
Keys are long unique passwords providers give (instead of the need to log-in with email, password every time you want to use the service)

Connect OpenAI, Anthropic, or any other compatible API by supplying your own keys. Prefer running models yourself? Point Sila to a local server or to an open‑source model and keep everything on your hardware.

## Mix and match

Different tasks call for different strengths. Use a fast model for brainstorming, switch to a high‑quality model for final drafts, or run a local model when you need absolute privacy. Sila keeps track of your providers across workspaces so you can pick the best option for each conversation.

## Why it's better than ChatGPT

ChatGPT limits you to the models it offers and requires a subscription for premium options. Sila lets you experiment with the latest models or even run them for free on your own machine, all while owning the results.
