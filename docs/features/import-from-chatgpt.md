# Import your chats from ChatGPT

You can import your chats, attachments and generated data from ChatGPT.

<TODO>Implement in Sila and then explain here how to do it</TODO>

## Why import?

Importing helps you maintain continuity while gaining [data ownership](../own.md) and avoiding [vendor lock-in](../the-problem-with-chatgpt.md).

## Transfer memory

In addition to importing your conversations, you can [learn what ChatGPT knows about you](../how-to/learn-what-chatgpt-knows-about-me.md) to see what it has in its memory if it's activated. This is particularly useful for setting up a [personal assistant](assistants.md) that knows your preferences and context.

## Transfer projects
Sila has [projects](../features/projects.md) which work exactly the same. At the moment ChatGPT doesn't allow you to export conversations with respect to projects (this is part of [the problem with ChatGPT](../the-problem-with-chatgpt.md)), but you can move your conversations manually after you import them from ChatGPT. You can re-create the same projects in Sila using custom instructions and files from ChatGPT's projects.

## Use both tools

You can continue using ChatGPT while using Sila as a backup. This gives you a local copy of your data and the flexibility to switch providers without losing your conversation history.
