# Chat

Sila’s chat works like ChatGPT.

## Attach files

Drag images or documents into a chat. They stay in your workspace, and the assistant can reference them.

## Branch replies

Start a new branch from any message to try alternatives. Switch or merge branches later.

## Edit messages

Fix or rewrite any message. The conversation updates in place.

## Faster workflows

Start new chats faster with an assistant’s defaults, and switch assistants quickly during a thread. See also: [Assistants](./assistants.md).
