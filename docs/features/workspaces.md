# Workspaces

Sila organizes everything you do into workspaces. A workspace holds your conversations, files and assistants for a project or interest. Unlike ChatGPT you choose where your workspace is stored. You can create as many workspaces as you want and switch between them with a click.

## You own your data

Every workspace is stored as ordinary files on your computer. There is no account or remote server; the content belongs solely to you. This means you can explore ideas, store sensitive material or experiment with any model without worrying about someone else having access.

## Sync on your terms

Want the same private workspace on another computer or phone? Place the workspace folder inside iCloud, Dropbox, Google Drive or any file‑syncing service. Sila's local‑first engine keeps each copy in sync and resolves changes automatically. You can even work offline; edits made on different devices merge when the folders sync again.

Your workspace can also be [shared with a team](./multiplayer.md).

## Why it’s better than ChatGPT

ChatGPT keeps conversations in a remote account that you can't easily move or back up. With Sila, workspaces are portable, private and easy to archive. You stay in control while still enjoying seamless multi‑device access and even [multiplayer](./multiplayer.md).
