# Assistants

Assistants in Sila are like GPTs in ChatGPT: reusable, configurable helpers that follow instructions, use selected AI models, and perform tasks across your workspace.

## What an assistant is
- A set of instructions and defaults your chats inherit
- A chosen model (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Ollama, or any OpenAI‑compatible API)
- Optional tools and data sources it can use
- A target folder for where new conversations are created

## Why use assistants
- Consistency: Apply the same style, constraints, and steps every time
- Speed: Start new chats with the right context and model pre‑selected
- Focus: Scope tools and sources to the task at hand
- Reuse: Share assistants across multiple chats and workspaces

## Typical uses
- Research assistant that always cites sources and saves results to a folder
- Coding reviewer that follows a specific checklist
- Writer that enforces tone, audience, and structure
- Support bot that searches a chosen knowledge base

## How it works in Sila
- Local‑first: Assistants, their instructions, and chats are plain files you own
- Bring your own keys: Use external providers on your terms
- Model‑agnostic: Switch models without losing your assistant’s context
- Workspace‑aware: Organize assistants per workspace and folder

Create assistants, iterate on their instructions, and use them across chats to standardize workflows while keeping full ownership of your data.
