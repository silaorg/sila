# Files and folders

You can upload files to workspaces and organize them in folders.

Attachments stay local to the chat, but you can move them to workspace assets to make them available to other assistants.

Upload files to workspace folders from the file browser. Use the Upload button or drag and drop files into a folder. Create folders and move files there to keep assets organized.

Reference files in a message by attaching them or by typing @ to pick a file from the workspace. Ask the assistant to use those files, write a new text document, or generate an image. Save or move the new files into folders from the file browser to keep related assets together.
