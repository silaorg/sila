# Themes

Sila includes many visual themes so you can set the mood for each workspace. Themes affect colors, surfaces, and components across the app.

## How themes work
- Per‑workspace: Each workspace stores its own theme and color scheme.
- Color scheme: Choose system, light, or dark. System follows your OS setting.
- Defaults: New workspaces start with a default theme (currently "cerberus") and system color scheme.

## Where themes are set
- In a workspace’s settings, pick a theme and a color scheme.
- Your choice is saved with the workspace, so switching workspaces also switches the theme.
- If a workspace doesn’t have a saved theme yet, Sila falls back to your last local choice.

See how workspaces organize your data and settings: [Workspaces](./workspaces.md).

## Notes
- Changes apply instantly across the UI.
- Works offline; settings are stored locally with the workspace.
- Advanced: Theme and color scheme are persisted per space and loaded on switch (see `packages/client/src/lib/state/theme.svelte.ts`).
