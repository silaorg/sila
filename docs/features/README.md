# Features of Sila

## Workspaces

Organize your chats and assistants into separate workspaces. Each workspace can have its own assistants, folders, theme, and language. Create multiple workspaces for different purposes and switch quickly.

## Local-first but syncs

Workspaces are stored locally. You can sync them with iCloud, Dropbox, or similar services to use across devices. Your assistants, chats, and generated data remain under your control. Sync conflicts are resolved automatically.
No accounts required. Sila works offline if the AI model runs on your device.

## Any AI models

From OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic to Ollama, plus any OpenAI-compatible API. Bring your own keys.

## Assistants

Create your own assistants with their instructions, AI models, and tools. Assistants can support different workflows. For example, one assistant can always search a specific source, reference a document, and create conversations in a chosen folder.

## Chats

When you chat, you can switch between assistants, branch conversations, and edit messages created by you or the AI.

## Tabs like in VSCode

Switch between tabs and split windows. It works much like VSCode. You can have multiple conversations open across tabs, chat with different assistants at the same time, and quickly switch between them.

## Many themes

Use different themes for your workspaces—from colorful to minimal. It's a simple way to set a mood or tell your workspaces apart.

## No subscriptions

Pay as you go for provider API costs or local compute if you run models yourself.

## Development
