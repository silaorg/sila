There are thousands of AI chat apps and many of them are open source. But none of them focus on several important things at the same time: data ownership, ease of use without hosting a server, portable workspaces for multiuser collaboration.

ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini and similar products own your data and try to hook you into being a lifetime user (subscriber, ads consumer, etc).

Open WebUI and 100s of similar products require you to host your own server and don't give you a simple way to start on your own.

Jan.ai and similar local-first products give you an app and local file storage, but their architecture doesn't allow you to seamlessly sync changes or provide a way to do multiuser collaboration.
