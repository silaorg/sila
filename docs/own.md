# Why owning your AI-related data is important

Owning your AI data keeps leverage, privacy, and flexibility in your hands - not a vendor's. As your assistants learn and generate more useful data - your [AI workspace](./features/workspaces.md) gets more valuable to you. You should be able to control where it's stored and who has access to it.

## What you should own
- Assistants: instructions, tools, memory, integrations
- Conversations: useful replies, questions, captured workflows and your thinking process
- Files: chat attachments, and generated documents and images
- Integrations: access to services your assistants use

## Why it matters
- Your data gets more valuable over time: Every new successful chat conversation, workflow that works, useful file added - makes the AI workspace more valuable to you.
- Privacy and compliance: Keep sensitive data local-first; choose where and how you sync.
- Portability: Use any model or provider now and switch later without losing context.
- Resilience: No single point of failure or account lockout.

## How Sila helps you own it
- Local-first by default: Your workspace lives on your device as plain files.
- Works offline: No account required; bring your own API keys if you use external models.
- Sync on your terms: iCloud, Dropbox, or your own storage - no centralized server required.
- Any AI models: OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Ollama, or any OpenAI-compatible API.
- Clear ownership and separation: Workspaces organize your assistants, chats, and files for sharing later if you choose. You can have multiple workspaces that can be stored in separate locations.

## The alternative: vendor lock-in
Centralized chat platforms will try to upsell you into more expensive tiers, and make switching costly. Read more in [The problem with ChatGPT](./the-problem-with-chatgpt.md). Sila is designed as a counterbalance - ChatGPT-like convenience with data you control.

## Bottom line
Own your assistants, chats, and outputs. Store them locally, sync safely, and switch providers freely. Thatâ€™s the default with Sila.
