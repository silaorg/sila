# Why owning your AI-related data is important

Owning your AI data keeps leverage, privacy, and flexibility in your hands—not a vendor’s. As your assistants learn and generate more, that data compounds in value. You should be able to store it locally, sync it on your terms, and move it to any model or provider when you want.

## What you should own
- Your assistants: instructions, tools, and configurations
- Your conversations: prompts, replies, context, and history
- Your artifacts: files, attachments, and generated outputs
- Your settings: models, keys, and integrations

## Why it matters
- Value compounds over time: Every chat, file, and refinement increases the usefulness of your workspace.
- Privacy and compliance: Keep sensitive data local-first; choose where and how you sync.
- Portability: Use any model or provider now and switch later without losing context.
- Resilience: No single point of failure or account lockout.
- Cost control: Avoid upsells tied to proprietary lock‑in.

## How Sila helps you own it
- Local-first by default: Your workspace lives on your device as plain files.
- Works offline: No account required; bring your own API keys if you use external models.
- Sync on your terms: iCloud, Dropbox, or your own storage—no centralized server required.
- Any AI models: OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Ollama, or any OpenAI-compatible API.
- Structured ownership: Workspaces (Spaces) organize your assistants, chats, and files for sharing later if you choose. See features in the [README](../README.md).

## The alternative: vendor lock-in
Centralized chat platforms can retain your conversations, upsell you into closed tiers, and make switching costly. Read more in [The problem with ChatGPT](./the-problem-with-chatgpt.md). Sila is designed as a counterbalance—ChatGPT‑like convenience with data you control.

## Bottom line
Own your assistants, chats, and outputs. Store them locally, sync safely, and switch providers freely. That’s the default with Sila.
