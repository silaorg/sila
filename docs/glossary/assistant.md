# Assistant

Reusable, configurable helper that follows instructions to perform tasks in a workspace.

Also could be called: agent, bot

- A chat inherits its assistant’s instructions, chosen model, tools, and target folder
- Works with OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Ollama, and OpenAI‑compatible APIs
- Stored locally as files you own; switch models without losing context
