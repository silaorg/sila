# Strengths of Sila

## Easy to start

## As powerful as ChatGPT
You can use Sila with any major, powerful AI models. It has all the same features as ChatGPT and a very similar interface.

## Private & Local
You decide where to store your data. You can store everything locally on your file system, and optionally sync with Dropbox, iCloud, etc. to use Sila across multiple devices.
